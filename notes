- do the blurring on load -- right now it starts at 0, but you need to
have it blurred when the page loads

- randomize the levels yourself

- make sure you load the CSS style sheet on the html page


FOR ATTENTIONAL PROBING:
- make the text box in a div container that's like 90% of the window size
- bc you want the attentional probe to flash over a letter in the word,
  make the attentional probe 10% radius and put the attentional probe IN
  the div container
